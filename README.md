# CI-CD tools 


Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are crucial practices in software development that aim to automate the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to production environments. Several popular CI/CD tools are widely used in the industry, each with its own strengths and features. In this repo i will demonstrate project in each of the selected tools:

## GitHub Actions:
